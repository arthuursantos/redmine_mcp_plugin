module RedmineMcpPlugin
  module Tools
    # Base class for exposed tools, now a thin layer over the MCP SDK's
    # `MCP::Tool`. Subclasses declare name, title, description and input schema
    # through the SDK DSL and add this plugin's authorization metadata through
    # `permission`/`write`/`destructive`.
    #
    # Permissioned record operations combine two authorization layers:
    #
    #   1. `permission` is checked through User#allowed_to?. Discovery checks the
    #      user's role alone, while execution also applies the OAuth token's
    #      narrower scopes.
    #   2. Record access additionally reads through core's .visible scopes.
    #
    # Redmine visibility scopes honor roles but not OAuth scopes, while
    # User#allowed_to? alone does not filter invisible records.
    #
    # Authorization is enforced with three locks:
    #
    #   * Discovery lock: `available_to?` decides whether the tool is mounted on
    #     the per-request server at all. It ignores OAuth scope narrowing so a
    #     role-permitted tool remains discoverable for step-up, while a tool the
    #     user's role denies stays out of discovery.
    #   * HTTP lock: McpController authorizes registered tools/call requests and
    #     owns role/read-only 403s and OAuth scope challenges.
    #   * Execution backstop: `run` re-checks read-only and permission before the
    #     tool body, defending against a controller bug or policy race.
